                  beyond his imagining. While visiting a public exhibition of
                  new breakthroughs in radiation manipulation and genetics,
                  Parker felt the bite of a common house spider exposed to a

                  realizing how much his life would change in the coming hours.

                  On the way home, the teenager unconsciously avoided a wayward

                  nearby building, finding himself miraculously able to stick to
                  it by his hands and feet. Quickly realizing he had somehow
                  acquired the abilities of a spider, he began testing his
                  new-found powers and marveled at their width and breadth.
                  Parker tested his spider abilities in the ring of a local
                  wresting competition and, wearing a mask to hide his identity,
                  easily bested the reigning champion.

                  Parker, an orphan, lived with his kindly Aunt May and Uncle
                  Ben and was wary of exposing them to the public scrutiny that
                  would surely ensue if he revealed his powers to the world, so
                  he adopted a suitable costume and the name of “Spider-Man” to
                  hide his true identity. He also designed and crafted two
                  wrist-worn “web-shooters” to approximate a spider’s
                  web-spinning capability, and with them swiftly became a smash
                  television personality. Now with money to take care of his
                  guardians and acclaim to salve puny Peter Parker’s wounds from
                  classmates, the young man grew cold to everything but his
                  media-darling career.

                  Everything changed when, in an act of selfishness, Parker
                  allowed a burglar to escape police arrest during a Spider-Man
                  appearance rather than intervene. Later, when he returned
                  home, he learned of his Uncle Ben’s murder at the hands of the
                  very same burglar and instantly felt the weight of hubris upon
                  his young shoulders. Vowing never to use his powers again for
                  his own gain, he tracked down his uncle’s killer as Spider-Man
                  and brought him to justice. From that moment on, he abandoned
                  his media star persona and spun his web solely to capture
                  criminals of all kinds.

                  Like his namesake, Spider-Man’s strength and agility stand far

                  ten tons and to leap and move at incredible speeds with high

                  An inner “spider-sense” allows him a high degree of awareness

                  to him personally, but also the general direction of its
                  approach. Combined with his unique fighting style, this grants
                  Spider-Man an edge in his battles that often times defies
                  logic.

                  are his web-shooters. Strapped to both his wrists and
                  activated by finger pressure applied to touch pads on his
                  palms, the shooters can spray a unique fluid of the hero’s
                  creation which solidifies to various thicknesses upon exposure
                  to air and form into “webbing.” The tensile strength of the
                  substance may be modified with each activation of the
                  shooters, but at its peak can stop a large vehicle and also
                  hold several persons for nearly two hours, after which, the
                  webbing begins to dissolve.
