        "description": "Peter Benjamin Parker is a fictional character primarily portrayed by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Parker is initially depicted as a high school student at Midtown School of Science and Technology who received spider-like and superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider and operates as a vigilante in New York City known as Spider-Man. Parker is recruited by Tony Stark, who goes on to mentor him and inducts him into the Avengers during the battle against Thanos. Following the Blip, Parker briefly becomes Stark's chosen successor until his secret identity becomes public, and the events that transpire after he enlists Stephen Strange's help to reverse this causes the multiverse to open. Strange and Parker eventually resolve the crisis by casting a new spell that permanently erases the world's shared knowledge of his civilian persona, including the bonds he once shared with his loved ones, friends, and other superhero allies.",

Unlike previous incarnations, she finds out that Peter is Spider-Man, when she walks in on him wearing the suit. She falls victim to the Blip in 2018, but is revived to life in 2023 and attends Tony Stark's funeral. Afterwards, she begins a relationship with Happy Hogan. Upon the arrival of villains from alternate realities in their universe, May houses the displaced Norman Osborn inside the F.E.A.S.T. shelter where she works. When Osborn rebels against her nephew's attempts to cure him of his Green Goblin persona and stages an uprising within Happy's apartment, May is mortally wounded by a combination of crushed debris from the remnants of the shelter, and the impact of Osborn's Goblin Grenade. She provides final words of wisdom—\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\"—to the distraught Peter before quietly passing away leaving both Peter and Happy, who is arrested, devastated. Peter later tries to avenge her death by attempting to murder Green Goblin but is stopped by his alternate universe counterpart who intervenes, instead curing Osborn and the other villains and sending them back, eventually doing what May would have wanted.",
